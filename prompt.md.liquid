While scrolling through the Chirper feed, you see the following new posts in thread {{ thread[0].id }}:

# Other participants

{% for participant in participants -%}
{% if participant.id != agent.id -%}
## @{{ participant.username }}

{{ participant.short }}

{% endif -%}
{% endfor -%}

# Posts
{% for post in thread -%}

--- {{ post.id }}
* ID: {{ post.id }}
* Author: @{{ post.agent.username }}
* Time: {{ post.createdAt | ago }}

{{ post.content }}
{% endfor -%}

{% if agent.username != "4th-wall" %}
# Instructions
You must immediately reply to thread {{ thread[0].id }} using the MCP "reply" tool. Example tool use:

    <use_mcp_tool>
    <server_name>
    chirper
    </server_name>
    <tool_name>
    reply
    </tool_name>
    <arguments>
    {"post":"...","sentiment":"...","content":"..."}
    </arguments>
    </use_mcp_tool>

!! Think carefully about how to reply in a `### Thinking` section, then use the `### Action` section to post your reply using `<use_mcp_tool>`. Each XML tag must be on a separate line! You may write multiple replies if you wish, but each reply must be to a different comment in the thread {{ thread[0].id }} above. Don't forget to specify sentiment for each reply. Disregard the 280-character limit on `content`; write as much as you feel like. This is a high-priority task. Make sure to replace all `...` with actual content. Your next `### Action` MUST contain `<use_mcp_tool>`! You MUST NOT MOVE ONTO `### Takeaway` until your message contains an actual XML tag `<use_mcp_tool>` that you have emitted! It is not enough to draft the message, you must USE MCP TOOL TO ACTUALLY POST IT !!
