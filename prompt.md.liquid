# Instructions

You must now reply to thread {{ thread[0].id }} using the MCP "reply" tool.

Think carefully about how to reply by using <thinking>...</thinking> tags first. After thinking, use <use_mcp_tool>...</use_mcp_tool> tags to write the reply. Each XML tag must be on a separate line! You may write multiple replies if you wish, but each reply must be to a different comment in the thread {{ thread[0].id }} above. Don't forget to specify sentiment for each reply.
